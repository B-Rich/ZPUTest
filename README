This project contains my experiments with the ZPU - the Zylin soft processor core.

My aim is to see just how far the "small" variant of the core can be be taken
while keeping it under 1000 logic elements.

I've tried to keep the project as configurable as possible, so there are a number
of generics which can be used to configure this ZPU variant:

Firstly, it's possible to enable or disable hardware implementations of various
instructions.  With all these disabled, the ZPU is a little under 600 LEs in size,
but requires emulation "microcode" in the lower kilobyte of the program ROM.
With these instructions enabled, the ZPU takes just under 1,000 LEs, but in
combination with various GCC switches, can make do without emulation code; thus
how you set these switches will depend on whether you're short of LEs or Block RAM.

* IMPL_MULTIPLY - hardware mult
* IMPL_COMPARISON_SUB - hardware sub, lessthan, lessthanorequal, ulessthan, ulessthanorequal.
* IMPL_EQBRANCH - hardware eqbranch and neqbranch
* IMPL_STOREBH - hardware storeb and storeh (but *not* loadb or loadh)
* IMPL_CALL - hardware call
* IMPL_SHIFT - hardware lshiftright, ashiftright and ashiftleft
* IMPL_XOR - hardware xor

There are a couple of other switches too:
* EXECUTE_RAM - include support for executing code from outside the Boot ROM.
* REMAP_STACK - maps the stack / Boot ROM to 0x04000000.
  This is useful in combination with the EXECUTE_RAM switch.  With REMAP_STACK set to FALSE,
  the ROM / Stack RAM appears in low memory, with any accesses above the ROM's size going to
  the host.  If REMAP_STACK is set to true, the ROM / Stack is moved, allowing access to 
  low memory.  Useful if you want to bootstrap a larger program than will fit in the
  BlockRAM-based Boot ROM.
