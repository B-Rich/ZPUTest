# Example manifest file
# Hexadecimal address comes first, followed by spaces, followed by the filename
# To avoid mangling the filename any more than needed in the limited boot firmware
# the filename should be 11 characters long, the last three being the file extension
# all upper case and padded out with spaces, like so:
# 10000  FN      EXT
# 20000  FILE2   IMG
# a blank line terminates the file list
