Another ZPU simulator?  Really?  Yes.

The one in the offical ZPU git repo is written in Java and requires gdb to work -
yet there's no pre-built gdb binary for the ZPU - so getting this up and running
and learning how to use it is going to be more work (and less educational!) than
writing a new simulator from scratch.

The ZPUino simulator has some x86 assembly language in it, so can't be built on
a 64-bit Linux install, and is also tightly coupled to the ZPUino way of doing
things.

The simulator isn't complete yet, but implements enough of the zpu-small-bram-stack
variant of the CPU that I've been experimenting with on retroramblings.net that it's
useful.
